## Background 

JSpardy! is a playable spinoff of my favorite game show, *Jeopardy!* I religiously watch *Jeopardy!* every night, and I hope to capture the feeling of being a contestant on the show through this game. For those unfamilar, *Jeopardy!* is a trivia-based game show where contestants buzz in to answer clues from a game board. The clues are divided into 6 categories, and each clue contains a dollar value that is awarded to the contestant that correctly answers it. JSpardy! will allow a player to select categories (or choose random ones) and play their own full game of *Jeopardy!* 


## Functionality & MVPs 

In JSpardy!, users will be able to: 

- Play a full game of *Jeopardy!* using real game clues from past episodes
- Select categories or choose random ones to play
- Keep track of their score
- Wager on daily doubles placed randomly across the board
- Participate in the Final Jeopardy round
- Play locally against another player

In addition, this project will include: 

- Full game instructions
- A production README
